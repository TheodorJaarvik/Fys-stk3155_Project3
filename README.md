# Instructions 

1. To run our models we need the final data file for training. This file is generated and added to the data folder after running the Pre_processing.py file once. 
2. Proceed with running the neural_network_model.py, which will output a keras file holding the model.
3. Run Model_Testing.py to test the model.
